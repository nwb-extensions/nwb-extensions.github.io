# NDX Catalog Changelog

## NDX Catalog 1.1.0 - July 26, 2024

- The Catalog is no longer rate-limited by the GitHub API. Records are pulled from the nwb-extensions GitHub organization every week, on pushes to this repo, and on demand. The website now displays those records instead of parsing records from the GitHub API on demand. Thanks to [@tuanpham96](https://github.com/tuanpham96) for his immensely helpful [contribution](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/nwb-extensions.github.io/pull/17).
- Replaced the extension sharing and versioning policies and proposal review process document that were cached on this site with links to the [nwb.org website](https://www.nwb.org/policies-overview/).
- Rendered safe Markdown from each extension's README.
